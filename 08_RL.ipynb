Specifically, let's say you select the action UP, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going UP, 1/3 of going RIGHT and 1/3 of going LEFT. Similarly, if you select LEFT, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going LEFT, 1/3 of going UP and 1/3 of going DOWN.\n",

We provide you the NumPy softmax function to normalize the Q-Values into a probability function to use before sampling.
